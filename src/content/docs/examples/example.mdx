description: A reference page in my new Starlight docs site.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import importedCode from "/src/pages/sse/[...path].ts?raw";

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

<button id="merge-button" data-on-click="@get('/sse')">
  Merge
</button>
<p id="merge-text">Merge here</p>

<Code code={importedCode} lang="ts" title="sse.ts" />
