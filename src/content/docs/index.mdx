import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Include Datastar with a single **13.3 KiB** file and start adding reactivity to your frontend immediately. Write your backend in the language of your choice! Official **SDKs** are available to help you get up and running even faster, with more languages on the way.

Getting started is as easy as adding a single script tag to your HTML.

```javascript
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/starfederation/datastar@v1.0.0-beta.3/bundles/datastar.js"
></script>
```

Then start adding frontend reactivity using declarative data-\* attributes.

```html
<input data-bind-title />
<div data-text="$title.toUpperCase()"></div>
<button data-on-click="@post('/endpoint')">Save</button>
```
